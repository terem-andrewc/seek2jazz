## Problems with SEEK applicant alerts and JazzHR

When using JazzHR's email for SEEK job applicant alerts, duplicate JazzHR applicants are sometimes created. When an applicant applies with a resume + cover letter, JazzHR assumes each attachment is a new candidate, creating a duplicate applicant.

While duplicate applicants can be fixed in JazzHR, fixing involves alot of manual work, increasing load on the HR team.
